# HEB Image Object Detection API

This service runs image object detection using Amazon's Rekognition service. Clients can utilize the endpoints provided to: upload (or download via url), analyze and label objects detected, search by object lables, and fetch via ID.

## Get Started

In the project directory, run:

```console
$ npm install
```

to install dependencies.
<br/><br/>

Then run:

```console
$ npm start
```

to start the server. The web server will listen on port 3000.

### `Front End React App`

The server provides a bare bone HTML page, but for a better experience head over to \
[image-detection-react](https://github.com/patrickmcclain/image-detection-react) and run the front end web app built in react.
